# What will happen if we not import React ?
    our files will not work, in order to work with JSX we need to import React

# What will happen if we console our Index.js/StaticPage.js file
    A JS object. React elements that describe what React should eventually add to the real DOM for us.This will print our all our functions in the form of object.

# What's wrong with the code ?

    const page = (
        <h1>Hello React</h1>
        <p>Hi, Corporate Slave</p>
    )
    
    Here, We need all our JSX to be nested under a single parent element.

# What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative" ?
    Declarative means i can tell the computer what to do and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means i need to tell it how to do each step.
